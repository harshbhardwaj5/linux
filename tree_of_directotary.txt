[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/b{d,e}/c{f,g}
[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/{b/d,e}
[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/{b/{d,e}

#this we have created a commad in which a dir will have b and b will have d and e 
now we will create a whole structure


[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/{b/{d,e},c/{f,g}}
[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/{b/{d/{i,l/{m}}},e},c/{f,g}}

[adhoc@localhost Desktop]$ mkdir -p a/{b/{d/{i,l/{m}}},e/h/{k}},c/{f,g}}

in this we have created a dir within many directories 
 
a in b,c
b in d,e
cin f,g
fin h
d in i and j as exmaple
